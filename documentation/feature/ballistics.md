# Overview

## Realistic ballistics
Changes include adjusted muzzle velocity, air friction and dispersion based on real life values.

## Weaker body armor
Decreases protection values of vests, CSAT uniforms and various campaign only gear to levels comparable to Arma 2.

## Realistic silencers and subsonic ammunition
Silencers no longer decrease the muzzle velocity and are generally less effective when used with normal ammunition. They now only remove the muzzle blast and flash. To prevent the crack caused by supersonic projectiles, ACE introduces subsonic ammunition for the 7.62mm caliber. This is also fully compatible with AI.

## Armour piercing ammunition
Armour piercing rounds have higher penetration values against light armoured targets or other obstacles on the battlefield. Their drawback is a slightly decreased man-stopping power. AP rounds are available in multiple calibers incudling 5.56mm and 7.62mm.

## IR-Dim tracer ammunition
IR-Dim ammunition is similar to tracer rounds, but their tracers are only visible using night vision devices.

## M118 long range ammunition
The M14 EBR now uses ammunition with decreased muzzle velocity and air friction to improve precision and energy retention at long ranges.

## Flash suppressors
Flash suppressors are similar to sound suppressors and prevent the muzzle flash from reducing visibility without decreasing combat effectiveness. Flash suppressors are available for the calibers 5.56mm, 6.5mm, 7.62mm, .45 ACP and 9mm.

## Fully config-based
This module uses configuration changes only and does not decrease game performance.
