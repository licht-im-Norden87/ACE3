## Overview

### Fire control system
Offers a custom fire control system for tanks and helicopters. It enables engaging stationary and moving targets. 

### Manual lasing targets
Changes the default rangefinders, including those in vehicles, to require manual lasing.

### Air burst ammunition
Anti air cannons can now use airburst ammunition. It will explode on the FCS' zeroed in range.


## Usage

To engage moving targets, place the crosshair on the enemy vehicle and press and hold tab. Follow the moving target with your crosshair for about 2 seconds and release tab. The optic will now be adjusted sideways to ensure a hit.
