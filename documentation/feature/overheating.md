## Overview

### Weapon Jamming
Adds a propability to jam a weapon when firing. Jams can be cleared by 
reloading or by using the clear jam-key.

### Temperature simulation
Introduces weapon temperature simulation depending on weapon and bullet
mass. Hot weapons are more prone to jamming. Depending on weapon type 
the accuracy and in extreme cases the muzzle velocity might be reduced 
on high temperatues. Adds smoke puff and heat refraction effects to 
indicate this.

### Spare barrels
Adds the ability to changes barrels on machine guns to compensate for those 
effects.


## Usage
To clear a jammed weapon, press Shift+R.
